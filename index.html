    <h1>How to contribute images to this resource:</h1>
    <p>
      Fork this repository, then make a pull request. Your images can be in any
      format, and should be around 100x100 pixels. Any larger and they will take
      too long to download. To generate/update the dir.json files, run
      deploy.sh.
    </p>

    <h1>How to use the images from this repo:</h1>

    <p>
      1. View the available folders by visiting this url:
      <a href="https://spaulmark.github.io/img/dir.json"
        >https://spaulmark.github.io/img/dir.json</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Once you've selected a folder (for example: Cats), query the dir.json
      in that folder by visiting this url:
      <a href="https://spaulmark.github.io/img/Cats/dir.json"
        >https://spaulmark.github.io/img/Cats/dir.json</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      3. This json will give you a list of files you can use. For example, if
      you wanted to view Mewoth.png, it would be located at
      <a href="https://spaulmark.github.io/img/Cats/Meowth.png"
        >https://spaulmark.github.io/img/Cats/Meowth.png</a
      >
    </p>
